# Google Meet Hack

## Description

I also usually skip my online lectures but Im always forgetting to leave the meeting after the lecture is finished.
So I made this extension, inspired by ProgrammerGaurav, which auto leaves meet when the # of participants is at a certain amount. 

Ex: If the no. of participants drops down from 20 to 3 then the meet will automatically get ended.

## PLEASE READ

If it isnt working for you after you install this please go to console and put a picture of the error in issues.
ALSO please make sure to reload the page after installing it wont setup the # of people if you don't reload.
ALSO last one i promise, make sure your screen is wide enough for the number of people to be visible if you cant see it the code cant see it.

TODO: 
Make this for zoom :/
